A Discord bot for the Python Discord community which changes with the seasons, and provides useful event features.

## Motivations

We know it can be difficult to get into the whole open source thing at first. To help out, we started the HacktoberBot community project during [Hacktoberfest 2018](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) to help introduce and encourage members to participate in contributing to open source, providing a calmer and helpful environment for those who want to be part of it.

This later evolved into a bot that runs all year, providing season-appropriate functionality and issues that beginners can work on.

## Getting started
Before you start, please take some time to read through our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
